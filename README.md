## Overview
This project provides a thorough exploratory data analysis of Flipkartâ€™s e-commerce product listings using Python and Pandas. The objective is to analyze raw, semi-structured data and extract insights from it, by performing data cleaning, feature engineering and categorical analysis. It converts non-standardised product metadata to structured information, which can be useful in patterns emerging in product categories, listing structure, and how the market is distributed; and can aid in the investigation of business intelligence, methods for understanding customer behaviour or for recommendation on an e-commerce platform.

## Objective

- Carry out data cleaning and transformation to prepare the data set for analysis.
- Extract and engineer date and category features from complex fields such as crawl_timestamp and product_category_tree.
- Categorize products into hierarchical levels (main, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) for logical analysis
- Identify and remove redundant, non-informative columns to simplify data set.
- Enable systematic reporting around product trends, frequency of categories, and listing data.

## Conclusion
This analysis successfully transforms a semi-structured e-commerce dataset into a clean, structured dataset that can be used to produce business insights. The extracted features including category hierarchy and temporal data can inform strategic decisions on product curation, marketing, and customer targeting. Furthermore, the project demonstrates the ability to work with messy real-world data and derive information from it that can be used to influence business and industry.
